# Hapi.js composer generator
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-url]][daviddm-image] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

This generator creates a new [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) project with all the boilerplate you need to get started. The hapi-plugins selection in the prompt will be automatically added to the composer manifest.

Updated to support Hapi 8.x

## Installation

Install the generator by running: `npm install -g generator-hapi-composer`


## Usage

Make a new directory, and cd into it.
Run the following command and follow the prompts.

```
yo hapi-composer
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to first change to a new directory if you don't want to overwrite existing files._

## Hapi plugins
The generator provides the following optional selection of hapi-plugins by default:

- [lout](https://github.com/spumko/lout)
- [hapi-auth-cookie](https://github.com/spumko/hapi-auth-cookie)
- [bell](https://github.com/spumko/bell)
- [hapi-auth-basic](https://github.com/spumko/hapi-auth-basic)
- [tv](https://github.com/spumko/tv)
- [scooter](https://github.com/spumko/scooter)
- [poop](https://github.com/spumko/poop)
- [good](https://github.com/spumko/good)
- [reptile](https://github.com/spumko/reptile)
- [yar](https://github.com/spumko/yar)
- [crumb](https://github.com/spumko/crumb)

You can customize the hapi-plugins prompt by editing the .yo-rc-global.json file which is located in your home directory. The file will be generated after the first run if it doesn't already exist. The default hapi-plugin configuration in .yo-rc-global.json looks like this:

```

  "hapiPlugins": [
